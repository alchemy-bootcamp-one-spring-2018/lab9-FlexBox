        <p>An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
        </p>
        <p>We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.
        </p>
        <p>I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.
