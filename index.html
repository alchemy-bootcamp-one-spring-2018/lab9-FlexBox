                    <p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. This is the way you take out your flustrations.</p>

                    <p>We'll have a super time. We'll make some happy little bushes here. There comes a nice little fluffer. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions.</p>
