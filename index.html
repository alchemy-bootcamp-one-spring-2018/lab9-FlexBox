    <p>Burn her! Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, how'd you become king, then? It's only a model. Well, what do you want? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Shut up! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
            
    <p>Look, my liege! Shut up! Will you shut up?! What a strange person. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
    
    <p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
